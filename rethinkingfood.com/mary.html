<h1>Food for Thought</h1>
<h2>By Mark Munger</h2>
<h3>It's difficult to know what food even is nowadays, let alone how our choices affect our health, our economy and our planet.  This is an exploration into what we talk about when we talk about food.</h3>
<p>What is food? Food is sustenance. Food is a good. Food can be used to make food, and food can be as simple as a single piece of fruit. However we define food, we have to make choices about food, every day. From simply answering the question "What do you want to eat?" to considering how eating pineapple in Chicago affects the land in Hawaii and the air in Denver, food affects our lives simply and profoundly, as individuals and as a group. This documentary explores how people make the decision of what to eat.</p>
